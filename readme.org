* Helm Dired History
[[http://melpa.org/#/helm-dired-history][http://melpa.org/packages/helm-dired-history-badge.svg]]
------------



someone like to reuse the current dired buffer to visit another
directory, so that you just need open one dired buffer. but the bad
point is ,you can't easily go forward and back in different dired
directory. helm-dired-history can remember dired directory you have
visited and list them using `helm.el'.

integrating dired history feature into commands like dired-do-copy and
dired-do-rename. What I think of is that when user press C (copy) or R
(rename) mode, it is excellent to have an option allowing users to
select a directory from the history list.

after integrated the initial-input of `dired' `dired-other-window' and
`dired-other-frame' are changed from default-directory to empty, and
the first element of history is default-directory,so you can just
press `RET' or `C-j' to select it.

* Installation:
The easiest way to get started is to install the package via [[http://melpa.org/][MELPA]]

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (package-install 'helm-dired-history)
#+END_SRC

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(require 'savehist)
(add-to-list 'savehist-additional-variables 'helm-dired-history-variable)
(savehist-mode 1)

(with-eval-after-load 'dired
  (require 'helm-dired-history)
  ;; if you are using ido,you'd better disable ido for dired
  ;; (define-key (cdr ido-minor-mode-map-entry) [remap dired] nil) ;in ido-setup-hook
  (define-key dired-mode-map "," 'dired))
#+END_SRC
